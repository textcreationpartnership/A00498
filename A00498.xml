            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This note firſt geuen, that ſainct Paul often with ſomme force, repeateth this name, <hi>A brother:</hi> He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth that this is the Scope and drifte of all.

<pb facs="tcp:26139:6"/>enemies of the goſpell ſake, who do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre and blaſpheme all that doth come from vs: ſeing they abhorre and blaſpheme Chriſt, and the goſpell hit ſelf, hit ſhold not only, not adme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thoſe, but rather ſhold more confirme them in euel, and very much offend ſuch, which haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued Chriſt, whileſt the Miniſter preacheth vnto them, trueth vtterly voyed of examples. For they ar many, which hardly can be perſwaded, that we haue all thinges in Chriſt whileſt mens Inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions, are had in ſuch price and eſtimacion. Owte of queſtion greate fault is here in, nowe a dayes committed, and that not of the rude and common ſort of people: But of the hed proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and chief goſpellers.

Surely the caſe thus ſtanding, workes alſo wherin men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue put there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidences, more then in Chriſt, are to be forſaken, and men muſt remembre that there can be no fellowſhip, had betwene Chriſt and Antechriſt.</p>
               <p>Againe, hit is a thing very abſurd and foliſh, that becauſe, that falſhod hath by littell and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and of lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge time crept in, and growen, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to go aboute to preſcribe longe time alſo to

Certainly if we ſhall not receaue Chriſt, ſo ſone as we knowe him: we ſhall neuer enioy him. Moſes, Samwel.

               <p>Wherfore it is nothing worth, that they ſaie, who allawaies bragge, that there ar greater thin ges to be vrged, then reformation or admend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ceremonies, ſo become Patrones to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techriſtes relictes. As for ceremonies, they ar co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gniſances or teſtimonies of oure Religion, and therefore we alſo begin oure Religion with the ceremonie of Baptiſme: and if any be to be recea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued againe, by meanes of his repentaunce, after that he is excommunicated for his wickednes, he is ſtraight reconciled to the chirch, by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the ſupper: <hi>Wherefore they muſt nedes be vveake in the faith of Chriſt, vvhich differre the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing of Antechriſtes ceremonies, and nevvnes of lyf vvill ſurely, verie lately appere in them, if euer hit appere at all And in dede vve ſe at this day cold and ſlack pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding in chriſtian Religion, and profeſsion, in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vvhere Antechriſtes ceremonies be born vvithall, and all thinges much more liuely, and effectuall, vvhere they be abolished and done avvay. For if thei ſtay at any time, this onely is the cauſe, that the vvord of God, either is not thouroughly credited, or not estemed accordinglie.</hi> For howe ſo euer, thoſe that ſuppoſe them ſelues to be ſtrong in faith, vſe not theſe thinges: where I praye yowe, is there zeale, for Chriſtes glorie, or
<pb facs="tcp:26139:7"/>there brethern, wheras they ſtill vſe them, ſo no doubt they do hit of weakenes of faith.</p>
               <p>Certainly as there is no agrement at all bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wene Chriſt and Belial, ſo ſincere and vnfained Chriſtians, can by no meanes abide any of Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtes trumpery. Although with this there zeale, they endeauor them ſelues to purge, the chirch here, as the glory of Chriſt may therby chiefly be auanced, yet to the weaker ſort they will haue ſuch reſpect, as to do nothing raſhely or owt of ſeaſone, but will teache the weak with gentelnes, to wax ſtronger in knowledge. Yet will they do there endeauour, with examples to bring them forward, not regarding the blindnes of a few, who ar to much addicted to Antechri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ceremonies, and perhaps no trew and vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned brethern. Offending there, whileſt verie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other weake ones, continually thinck thus with them ſelues. <hi>If theſe thinges vvere ſo euel, they ſhold ſurely be abolished: if either they vvere ſo good al men (eſpecially that reckon them ſelues Chriſtians) vvold in dede receaue and embrace them.</hi> Theſe men ſurely, if they be elect, ſhall at the lenght be confirmed, all though all the world offend them, and no man edifie them. But woe in the meane time, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, by whome they ar offended. Wherfore as ſone as trew godlines, hath ben preached and profeſſed of manny, Antechriſtes ceremonies, and rites muſt by and by be abrogated, neither muſt delay be made, till godlines be in all poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes growen vp to perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, els ſhold, that traſh, neuer be aboliſhed, and remoued.</p>
               <p>Theſe myld and toe, toe moderate and ſober Chriſtians, who can beare all Antechriſtian thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
<pb facs="tcp:26139:8"/>in verie deede like vnto them at Corinth, who knowing that an Idoll was nothing, did eate thinges offered vnto Idolles, and boaſted (as theſe our men do) in outward matters we ar free: what is that to me that another abuſeth the ſe thinges naughtely? I will vſe them well. For as thoſe weakened the faith of many, both in that they leſſe abhorred Idolles, through there exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple &amp; alſo in that they for the moſt part co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, ſo no doubt do theſe oure lukewarme goſpellers, nowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies.<note place="margin">What is Antechriſts ceremonies.</note> They know right wel that all Antechriſtes ceremonies (that is to ſay, all ſuch haue ben brought in withowt gods word) are not worth a-ruſh: And becauſe they ar owtward things wherin we haue liberty, they will vſe them as fre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly forſoth, not waighing that many things ar law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful, which ar not expedient, and that oure liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, muſt ſerue, either whome they in the meane time offend, or obſcure the glorie of Chriſt. For they confirme thoſe in there error, which as yet knowe not, that theſe thinges ar free, and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. As for the defenders therof, the profeſſed ennemies of Chriſt they make them glad and bold,<note place="margin">They shut Chriſt owte of Dores that brare with cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</note> and finally they weaken the febles faith, which had forſaken and caſt them awaie.</p>
               <p>Thus on God his name they prouide fairly for the weak ones, yea rather they ſerue herin there owne bellies, in that they ſtudie to gratifie, either Chriſtes ennemies, or els backſliders. <hi>For no man other then theſe, vvill earneſtly contende for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious ceremonies.

<pb facs="tcp:26139:8"/>hit. Surely vve haue to thanck theſe men, that as this day all thing is gone backvvard, and turned vpſide dovvne, in many places, vvhere the goſpell hath ben long time preached:</hi> wheras no example can be brought of like alteracion in thoſe places, where Chriſt being earneſtly, and purely preached, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies alſo ben reformed, according to the rule of his word. For as for thoſe thinges, which haue diſordredly, or confuſely happened, Chriſt either not at all, or not ſincerely preached, they apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taing nothing to vs.</p>
               <p>For aſmuch therefore, as Chriſt ſo ſore dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth offences, and crieth, woe vnto the world by meanes of offences, wo vnto the man by whome offence commeth: we muſt with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence take hede both in theſe and other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that we be offenſiue to no man, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the littel ones, thoſe I meane not, that ar in in age only ſuch but in faith and vnderſtanding alſo. The perfect knowledg of God and Chriſt is lyff euerlaſting, whatſoeuer therefore may by any meanes, either hindre or obſcure hit, let hit neither be ſpoken, ne yet don of vs: but to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of oure powers let vs remoue thoſe things away. Then let vs prouoke them, both by exhortations, and examples, that men will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe thoſe thinges in there lyff, geuing no pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce herin, either to oure oune affections, or other mens ſeing that it is better to be drowned in the ſea, then to giue offence, &amp;c.</p>

A Magiſtrate is a choſen perſon and that of God that he ſhold, defend the lawes, and peace, and repreſſe and hold downe vices, and all thinges that ar euel, with poniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and his ſword.

               <p>FIrſt for aſmuch, as I entend to write of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges indifferent, as they ar named, and ſome ar ſo in deede, it is beſt to tell what this word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different meaneth. Indifferent is called in the Greke <hi>Adiaphoron,</hi> and in Latine <hi>Indifferens,</hi> and in Duytch <hi>eine mittelding.</hi> And hit ſignifieth a thing, wherof is made no matter, whether a man kepe hit or do not kepe hit, or whether hit be hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led after this manner, or that manner. There ar in the Chirch certaine thinges which ar indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and that there is ſuch in the chirch of God, it may eaſely be proued by Paul, as in the former to the Corinthians the 7.8.10. and 14. chapiters, alſo to the Romanes in the. 14. chapiter may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere. Of which ſort ar: to liue maried, or vn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, ſo that hit be don in Chaſtitie, to eate mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes or to abſtaine therfro, to kepe daies, or not to kepe daies, withowte ſuperſtition, to take wagis of them, to whome a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preacheth to, or to take none at all, to vſe a preſcribed ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of teaching in the Temple, to heare or to ſinge.</p>
               <p>If any man wold call back againe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the garmentes or veſtementes of Ethniſh, or Popiſh ſacrifices, and bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches after the vſe of them were once put downe, he ſhold do contrary to that which is ſemely and comenly.</p>
               <p>It lieth not in the power of any man, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine any worſhippings of God, withowte the commaundement of God.</p>
               <p>Al thinges that ar indifferent, ar ſo far indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb facs="tcp:26139:14"/>as they ſerue for the glorie of God, and the profit of the Chirch. But if they paſſe beyond thoſe bondes, they ar not indifferent: but ar, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines, and abhominations, and by all meanes, of all men to be eſchewed.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer Antechriſt doth, theſame he doth for the Diuelles ſake, whoſe vicar he is, and of whome he is ſtirred vp to play his part: And whatſoeuer vnchriſtian Princes do in Religion, they do hit for Antechriſtis ſake, and his ſeates ſake, as the letters of the Pope, vnto the Biſhops, and the Biſhops letters ſent to Popiſhe Princes, &amp; to diuers chirches, beare witnes. And further, whatſoeuer the Popiſhe Princes, and vnchriſtian courtes do in theſe matters, and chaunges, they do hit for the pleaſure &amp; fauor of the ſupreame gouernors. Alſo whatſoeuer thold diuines do in theſe matters, they do hit to gratifie the Court, and the inferior Princes. At the laſt, whatſoeuer the younger diuines do, either to ſet forth or not to hindre this miſchieff of indifferent matters, they do hit for the pleaſure of there old Maſters. Wherfore from the firſt to the laſt, they ſerue all Antechriſt, and the Diuell, and committ whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with the greate whore, and drinck of her cup, as hit is prophicied in th'apocalips (not wit-owt a cauſe) of the laſt times.</p>
               <p>We nede not to care for that which ſome do ofte time rehers, that the chirch hath allwaies ben in ſomme bondage, for although hit hath ben allwaies in politick bondage, yet ſhe neuer did tempre her ſelf, or faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her to the Religion of vngodly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither wold God, that ſhe ſhold be ſubdued vnto any ſpiritual bondage, But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:26139:14"/>that ſhe ſhold ſtedfaſtly defend her liberty, and not to be made the bond woman of men, ſeing that ſhe is redemed with the precious blood of Chriſte: Wherfore ſeing that theſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ar thruſt vppon the chirch whether ſhe will or no, and that of the greateſt, and moſt openly knowen ennemies of Chriſt (that is of the Pope and both of learned and lay Papiſtes) it is not lawfull by any meanes to receaue them, neither ar they thinges indifferent, but the wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of Antechriſt and Antiochus.</p>
               <p>Oure indifferentiaries that ar of ſtowter ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maches, would not beſo nice, and of a ſtraight conſcience, that they dare not defie the gold of the golden calf but that they wold deſier ſome far part of hit to be giuen vnto them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things that haue ben offered in Idol ſeruice, or ſerued Idolatry, they ar Idolatrous, &amp; can not ſerue God, and he wold that ſuch ſhold be caſt awaye.</p>
               <p>The braſen ſerpent was ordeined of GOD,<note place="margin">VVhat then to ſurpleſſes.</note> and that by Moſes the ſeruant of GOD, and his greate Prophet, but after hit ſerued Idolatry, it was no more God his ſerpent, or Moſes ſerpent, but the ſerpent of Idolaters, and the Diuelles ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and Ezechias is praiſed (who brak-hit) for that deede.</p>
               <p>Euen as we defie and abhorre, the garments or cote of a theeffe, of a Murtherer of A Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or of a common whore, though the garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hit ſelf be innocent and hath done no harme, neither will any honeſt man do ſo much as gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly touch hit: So all they that ar godly in dede, defie ſuch Popiſh trifles with all there hartes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus
<pb facs="tcp:26139:15"/>that they haue ſerued in the Popedome, &amp; ben occupied with abuſes and wickednes: and haue ſerued the ſacrificers that were polluted and defiled with idolatry.</p>
               <p>Auſtin ſayth, that faith is in great ieoperdy, when it is amongeſt a great nomber of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p>This is moſt trew in all thinges, that the man that is occupied about many thinges doth not ſufficientlie take hede to euerye one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and therefore it is trulie ſaid:</p>

               </q>
               <p>SO the people, being charged to kepe all the commaundementes of god and his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and more ſtraitlie commaunded to kepe mo ordinances of men then goddis commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, muſt nedes coldlye kepe ſome of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandementes of God.</p>
               <p>If that the indifferentiaries go forward to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the chirch of Chriſt as they haue begon, and will ſet in the place of godlye and lerned prechers: whom they haue put away fooles and courtlie flatterers, ſhortly we ſhall haue no god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye preachers at all.</p>
               <p>Were there is a heauie bondage in ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and in the worſhipping of God, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the glad libertie of Chriſt be.</p>
               <p>Ceremonies ar the cheife ſinewes or ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the popedome: and the greateſt poſtes and ſtayes of religion ſtand therein amonge the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes. When the indifferentiaries propound,
<pb facs="tcp:26139:15"/>offer vnto the miniſters (that do not gladlye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue any popiſh thinge) the quere cote, called in duch <hi>chorrok</hi> (which we call commonlie in engliſh a ſurpleſſe,) and they will not receyue it: then the traditioners make exclamation, ſaiyng, what a ſmall matter is it to weare a ſurpleſſe, or a whit cote aboue a blak, but in dede if they can get the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once in theſe cotes, they will afterward deliuer them to <hi>the Romaines that they may buffet them,</hi> as the old Romaines did handle Chriſt when they buffeted him, hauing the white cote vpon him which they put on againſt his wyll.</p>
               <p>What other thing goeth the deuell about, with all his thowſand craftes and ſubtelties, but to confirme the wicked in theyr wickednes, and to geue them occaſion to triumph ouer the trew chirch, and ouer Chriſte him ſelf, and to blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the holie name of the lord, and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie part to diſcourage and make ſad the holie goſte in godlie men, and to make them faynt in godlines, &amp; at length, alſo to doubt of the whole doctrine of the trew chirch, what thinge can more make afrayd, and make faynte ſouldiers, then to ſe theyr captaynes quake and tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble for feare? Ceſar ſayde that he had leiuer fyghte with an hoſte of Lions, that had a hart for theyr Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, then with an hoſt of hartes whoſe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne were a Lion.</p>
               <p>If any man ſhould ſpeake thus to another, and ſay thou haſt ſtolen from me an hundred crownes, I require of the that thow reſtore me them againe quietlie, leſt I be compelled to vſe gainſt the ſome more violent remedies: and yf this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accuſed of thefte, ſhould firſt paie him x
<pb facs="tcp:26139:16"/>crownes in part of payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; aſterw ard xx.crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſhould not he make him ſelfe giltie of theft and thereby be bound in paine of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to pay the hole ſome of money that is required of him, and ſhould not he ſhew him ſelf as readie to pay the reſt as theſe ij. portiones, of what ſoeuer pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or intent he ſhould do ſo? I ſuppoſe ſo in dede: Euen ſo, when we ar accuſed of the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and marring of the whole Religion of Chriſt, and ar commanded to reſtore it to the old eſtate againe and we begin to reſtore it in ſuch thinges as ſeme moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monlie before mens eies (as ar outward rites and ceremonies) do not we ſeme to condemne our owne ſelues: may not we be thought to deny our owne religion? how ſoeuer bewteous dreames we feyne in our thoughts.</p>
               <p>It was an indifferent thinge, for Chriſt to waſh his handes, yea it had a ciuill and a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſe, for it is good manners and ciuilitie to come to the table rather with waſhed handes then with foule handes, beſides that, after the doctrine of the phiſitiones of Salerne, it is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for the eies, to waſhe the handes oft, yet not withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding all theſe, Chriſt woulde not waſhe his handes with the Phariſes, becauſe he would ouerthrow their traditiones, and would not ſeme by his waſhing to confirme and alow their traditiones.</p>
               <p>It is not the poinct of a good chriſtian, and as litle the office of a good diuine, to beleue that, by angring of God and by ſwaging of mannes wrath, that we ſhall come to any perfect peace. For tyrantes ar only as it were certaine roddes
<pb facs="tcp:26139:16"/>in goddes hande, as God witneſſeth him ſelfe, in eſay the Prophit, wherefore the hand ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be pacified and ſwaged from wrath, then the rod but if it were poſſible to pacifie &amp; pleaſe the rod, that it ſhoulde not beate vs againſt the will of the hand: then were it to be feared that the hande ſhoulde caſt the rod away and take a Betell or a Maule and breake vs all as ſmall as Powlder.</p>

               <p>What boldnes is this, that men dare geue vnto goddis enemies any part of the treaſures of the chirch, which the ſonne of God hath geuen vnto it.</p>

               <p>As they that put on the Crowne of thorne vpon Chriſtes head to mock him, gaue him no honor, (although they ſemed to make him a Kynge) but greued him very ſore and put him to muche payne. Euen ſo they that <hi>vvill bevvtifie and bonor the Sacramentes and Chirch of Chriſt vvyth the ceremonies of his aduerſary</hi> Antichriſt, do not honor trulye Chriſt and his ſacramentes but diſhonor them and deface them.</p>

               <p>Theſe thynges that are vttarly to be remoued from the church, are of two ſortes, ſome haue ſo manifeſt impietie annexed to them, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I, and gather. Yf they changed not theyr gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or apparell whan they went to gods ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, then they vſed none for theim that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Myniſterie of the goſpell.</p>

We are to be diſcerned (ſaith he) from the common people or other, in doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne not apparell, in conuerſation not in habit, in puritie of mind not in attire: For yf we begine to geue our ſelues to nouelties, wee ſhall contemne and caſt awaye the order that the Fathers haue deliuered, and lefte vs and ſhall make a place for ſuperfluous ſuperſticions: wee muſt not therfore drawe the ſimple mindes of the faithfull to ſuch thinges, for they muſt rayther be inſtructed, then begiled, and mocked, neither muſt we deceiue theire bodylie eyes, but poure in precepted into theire mindes. Thus far he, yet can we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, but as men bend, and inclyne to ſuperſticion of them ſelues: ſo ſome kyned of garmentes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though verye ſimple and plaine had crepte into many Churchis before this mans dayes. For Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſter no doubt gaue the occaſion. But Carolus (called the great) finiſhed the matter as ſtories beare wittnes. Now it is made manifeſt that the vſe of peculiare apparell in the church or eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall perſones, is a mere deuiſe and inuention of men, and therfore to be reiected for this cauſe if there were no more.</p>
               <p>They which wolde kepe thuſe of this appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell in the Church as a thinge inſtituted of God, refer the ſame to Aarons preyſthoode, but they

For we knowe by the ſcriptures, that Chriſt is not a Prieſt after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Aaron, but of Melchiſedech, &amp; that Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s priſthood was extinguiſhed, and toke ende in Chriſte with all the parts therof, among the which we recken alſo the apparell. Therfore Chriſt the verie wiſdome of the father vſed no new, or peculiar kynd of apparell in holie mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterye, neyther appoincted any other to be vſed. For that the figuratiue prieſthod as a ſhadowe was perfited, and ended in Chriſt the one and onelye Prieſt. All they therfore that call agayne Aarons apparell into the Chirch, diſhonor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes prieſthod, as though beynge the lyght it ſelf, he nedid ſhadowes, neither wyll that excuſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, to ſay that all Aarons prieſthod is not called into vſeagayne, but ſome parte therof onelye: but he that receyuith a parte, doeth not reiect the wholle. But all Aarons prieſthode being a figure and ſhadowe is no doubt to be reiected, for that it is abrogated, and as many as do reſtore againe thoſe thynges that the auctorytie of gods worde hathe deſtroyed and abrogated, are tranſgreſſers of gods lawe. Paule therfore well teachith, that the bond mayde is to be caſt forth &amp; hir Sonne, ſingnifiyng that all the bondage of the lawe is to be reiected, after the lyght of the goſpell is ſpronge forth and riſen, and he wyilith vs not to ſuffer our ſelues to be remoued from our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye in Chriſt, now it is to playne that the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and commaandementes of whatſoeuer kynd of appparell peculiar, in gods myniſterye is a tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of gods lawe: For becauſe Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode is called in to vſe agaye.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:26139:23"/>
               <p> If any man by occaſion of the firſt argument deny that the garmentes are a portion of Aarons prieſthoode, and ſay that they were by a certaine libertye brought in of the Byſhopes of Rome, to adorne and ſet forth prieſtlye ordar, yet ſaith he not enough why they may be lawfully retained, we knowe that the Pope of Rome is very Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſte him ſelfe, wherfore his prieſthode alſo is Antichriſtian, wherby Chriſtes prieſthod who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie is foyled and vtterlie troden vndar fote. But foraſmuch as the chiefeſt part of the prieſthod of the Pope conſiſtith in Ceremonies, Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſhauing, Miters, and garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, for with owt theſe they accoumpt no man Byſhoppe, and they coumpt hym Byſhop whatſoeuar he be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe, that is ſet oute with theſe thinges, yt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowith that yf we condemne the popiſh prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod, for that it is Antchriſtian, wee ought to auoid all the partes and notes therof alſo. For how can A godlie and Chriſtian hart, loue the marke of the blaſphemus popiſh prieſthode?</p>
               <p>Where with Chriſtes priſthood is ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie contaminate and defiled. he therfore that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Antechriſt priſthod muſt hate alſo all the notes and markes therof. Againe he that loueth partes thereof can not hate the whole.</p>
               <p>Moreouar yf we knowe that the Popes prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, with all the notes and ſignes therof be Antechriſtes prieſthod and euerie worke of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techriſt be Satans worke, we muſt not promote and helpe it forward, but ouerthrow &amp; deſtroy it, if ſo be wee wylbe workers together wyth Chriſt, who came to deſtroy the workes of the Diuell, as the ſcriptures beare record.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:26139:23"/>
               <p> And let vs not thynke that it is law fell for anye man to inſtitute, reduce or kepe in vſe by his auctoritie theſe garmentes, for all power is giuen to edifie &amp; not to deſtroy, (as Paule ſayth) who in the ſame place ſaith, we can do nothing agaynſt the truth, but for the truth. And edefiyng is to build the faythfull vppon Chriſt, in fayth, hope charytie, and innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of lyffe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tendyng alwayes to more perfection: but the garmentes promote or helpe forth none of theſe thynges: but rayther obſcure Chriſtes face, bryng in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne agrement wyth Antechriſtes priſthod, or rayther a backeſliding to the ſhadowes of Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the bodye of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The truth is it for the whych Apoſtolike men and chriſtian Magiſtrates ought to trauell, and Chriſt is content wyth the ordinaunce whych he him ſelf hath left, neyther doth he any longar require ſhadowes: wherfore they muſt and wyll labore for it, not againſt it, by reuokynge thoſe thynges whych Chriſt hath deſtroyed and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
               <p>Furthermore Paule ſimplie admittith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into the Church but that which may ede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, (that is to ſay) encreaſe godlines peculiar gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes in the miniſterie edifie not, therfore are they not to be borne. thoſe thinges that miniſter a certaine counterfait, or fantaſticall occaſon to godlines, do not by and by edefie: but they muſt nedes giue Chriſtians a neceſſarie prouocation vnto godlines. But garmentes contrarie wyſe partlie encreaſe hautines, and pride in them, that vſe them: partlie hypocriſie: partlye both twain: And to miniſter occaſion to hypocriſie, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
<pb facs="tcp:26139:24"/>readie for them, yea it muſt nedes be. For yf that vertew be in thee, which thow imagineſt to be ſignified by the apparell, why by ſhewing of it doeſt thou take the reware of men? but yf it be not, art not thow a plaine Hypocrite? beinge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an other maner of man then thow preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt to bee? And thow canſte not eſcape by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng theſe priuat garmentes ſignifie no vertew in vs, but admoniſh vs as it were of our dutie and office. what then I pray yow admoniſhed the Apoſtles of their dutie and office? attire or the ſpirit of the Lord? the loue of the Chirch and Chriſt? doe they then forget their dutie, as often as they put theſe garmentes of? why rather me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate they not in the word of the Lord day and night, and therby mend their wayes, for that it Pearceth the ground of the hart? when apparell, can moue enelye the owtward ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What thing dothe Chriſt three ſcuerall times require of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be admoniſhed of his office, in feading his ſheeppe: ſuarly nothyng but loue.</p>
               <p>Againe it is to be feared, leſt it brede an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of merite, or ſome ſuch other ſollye, that the dignitie of the Miniſter or Sacramentes, or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge the word is dimmiſhed, vnleſſe theſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and pernicious garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes be vſed. this feare of mans merite alone ſhould moue vs that veſtimentes ought to be ſhutt out of the Temple with other ceremonies deuiſed by men. It is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly to giue ſuch occaſion of offence, or falling to the weake for whom Chriſt dyed. How caſie a matter it is to put conſidence in theſe thynges, experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hath taught vs ſo, that he that wayeth theſe thinges, and hath no conſideration therof,
<pb facs="tcp:26139:24"/>may ſeme not to be free from the ſuſpicion of vngodlines, neither can they excuſe them ſelues, that it is known to all men, that there lyeth no good, nor hurt, in the garmentes, for though we graunt this, this knowledge was in theſe dayes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were firſt brought in of the Byſhops: we are borne, not for our ſelues onelye, but wee ſerue the Chirch, and our poſteritie alſo: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to leaue Chriſtes religion verie pure, can not but be verie acceptable vnto god.

               <p>I know that ſome men bragg that the holie miniſterie is adorned and bewtyſied bye garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, but it is indede much obſcured and darckned therbye. For the apparell affecting and occupie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g mennes eies, do ſtay and hynder theyr myndes from the conſideration of ſuch ſpirituall thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as are don in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and drawe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to delyghtes and pleaſures of the Senſes.

Here farther add I that which Paule hath noted of mennes doctrines, that outwardly, they haue a ſpice and ſhew of wyſdome through ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſticion, and humblenes of the mind, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge of the bodie,<note place="margin">Coll. 2.</note> and not by any honor thereof

And this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie ſuerly makith that if a thinge be of his own nature free and indifferét, it nowe ceaſeth to be indifferent.

Is it not a verie hard bondage, and mere ſlauerye, to be driuen to a certaine kind of garment in the Church that ſauoreth ether gentilitye, or heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhnes or Araons prieſthode, or els Antechrit ſtianiſme and poperie that is ſo many wayes hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and no way profitable?</p>
